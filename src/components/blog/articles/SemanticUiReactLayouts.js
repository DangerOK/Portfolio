      As a Personal Project I created a Web-App using Semantic-UI-React and
      React.js to create a few faux websites and layouts to get more familiar
      with Semantic-UI in potential real world use cases.I thouroughly engjoyed
      the experience and will definitely be using Semantic-UI as my default CSS
      Framework for the forseeable future.
